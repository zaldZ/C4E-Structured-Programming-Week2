# Week 2 Honors Assignment
Use a struct to define a card as an enumerated member that is its suit value and a short that is its pips value.

Write a function that randomly shuffles the deck.

Submit your work as a text file.

Then deal out 7 card hands and evaluate the probability that a hand has no pair, one pair, two pair, three of a kind, full house and 4 of a kind.  
This is a Monte Carlo method to get an approximation to these probabilities.  Use at least 1 million randomly generated hands.

You can check against probabilities found in a standard table.
